MaterialX To Arnold Integration Tests
----------------------------------------------

Recall, integration testing is the phase in software testing in which individual 
software modules are combined and tested as a group. In this directory is the 
Arnold materialx procedural's integration tests, which tests combining it with
with the MaterialX and OpenColorIO libraries. The test are constructed to try
to maximize code coverage and simulate real world execution.

----------------------------------------------
OpenColorIO-Configs
----------------------------------------------

Both Arnold 5 and MaterialX use OpenColorIO. In order to test the MaterialX
procedural, we need OpenColorIO Config files. 

Arnold: 

Through the 'color_manager_ocio' node Arnold 5 can access color spaces 
defined in an OCIO config file.

On the 'color_manager_ocio' node, we will set the config parameter.
The config parameter i apath to the OCIO config file to use, if this is 
empty OCIO will try to load the config file from the 'OCIO' environment 
variable.

MaterialX: 

The recommended OpenColorIO configuration for MaterialX is ACES 1.0.3.

That is, the MaterialX team recommends:

https://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.3

As of this writing, there is no 1.0_r3 release/tag. So, we have downloaded at 
the latest commit on the master branch, which is the latest ACES 1.0.3:

https://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO-Configs/archive/84425e4b05ec7f18dd999a12c190020e23c26af0.zip

This is a 837MB+ size file. So, copied over only ACES 1.0.3.
