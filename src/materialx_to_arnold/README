MaterialX To Arnold Translation Library for the MaterialX Procedural Node

The following library is to handle all the translation from MaterialX to
Arnold for the materialx procedural. A functional programming approach is
used as it is good when you have a fixed set of things, and as your code
evolves, you primarily add new operations on existing things. This can be
accomplished by adding new functions which compute with existing data types,
and the existing functions are left alone. That is, the functional
programming approach is particularly well-suited for the task of translation.
